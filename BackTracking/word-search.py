Problem: Word Search
Category: Backtracking / DFS
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/

Statement:
----------
Given an m x n grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, 
return true if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, 
where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. 
The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example 1:
----------
Input:
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
]
word = "ABCCED"
Output: True

Example 2:
----------
Input:
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
]
word = "SEE"
Output: True

Example 3:
----------
Input:
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
]
word = "ABCB"
Output: False

How to Think:
-------------
When you read ‚Äúword exists in grid‚Äù ‚Üí immediately think:
  ‚Üí ‚ÄúDFS or Backtracking on a matrix.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the intuition process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Try starting the word from every cell in the grid.
2Ô∏è‚É£ If the cell matches the first letter of the word, 
    explore all 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Move to next letter (index + 1) recursively.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt revisit the same cell twice ‚Üí mark it as visited.
5Ô∏è‚É£ If all letters match in sequence ‚Üí return True.

üëâ This is a classic "Path finding in a grid" + "Backtracking" question.

Visualization:
--------------
Let‚Äôs say word = "ABCCED"

Grid:
A B C E
S F C S
A D E E

Try paths:
A(0,0) ‚Üí B(0,1) ‚Üí C(0,2) ‚Üí C(1,2) ‚Üí E(2,2) ‚Üí D(2,1)
‚úÖ Word found.

Algorithm Steps:
----------------
1. Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. If board[r][c] == word[0]:
     ‚Üí start DFS from here.
3. In DFS:
   - Base Case: if index == len(word): return True
   - Out of bounds or mismatch ‚Üí return False
   - Temporarily mark cell visited (e.g., with '#')
   - Explore 4 directions
   - Restore the cell after exploring (backtrack)
4. If any DFS returns True ‚Üí the word exists.

Complexity:
-----------
Time:  O(N * M * 4^L)
       - N*M = total cells
       - L = length of the word
       Each cell can branch up to 4 directions for each letter.
Space: O(L) recursion depth + visited path set

# üß© APPROACH 2: OPTIMIZED BACKTRACKING (In-place marking)
# ============================================================

"""
How to Think:
-------------
The brute-force approach uses a `visited` set ‚Äî this costs extra space.

Optimization idea:
‚Üí Instead of keeping a separate `visited` set, 
   we can modify the board temporarily to mark a cell as visited
   (e.g., replace character with '#').

Then, restore the character when backtracking.

This reduces space usage and makes DFS cleaner.

Algorithm Steps:
----------------
1. Start DFS from any cell that matches the first character.
2. In DFS:
   - If index == len(word) ‚Üí found full word ‚Üí return True.
   - If out of bounds or mismatch ‚Üí return False.
   - Temporarily mark cell with '#' to block reuse.
   - Explore all 4 directions recursively.
   - Restore cell after all directions explored.
3. If any DFS returns True ‚Üí return True.
4. Else return False.

Complexity:
-----------
Time:  O(N * M * 4^L)
Space: O(L) recursion stack (no extra visited set)
